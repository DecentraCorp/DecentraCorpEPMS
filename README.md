# DecentraCorpEPMS
Repository for DecentraCorps Embeded Program Mining Software(EPMS)

The EPMS is a simple Python script intended to be imported into any project. The EPMS allows any Device to mine Notio on the CryptoPatent Blockchain.

To use this script in your project you will first need your Idea patented in an IdeaBlock on the CryptoPatent Blockchain. This can be done by visiting the DecentraCorp dApp at https://decentracorp.now.sh with a web3 enabled browser connected to DecentraCorps Proof of Authority Network. Instructions for doing this can be found
here: https://github.com/DecentraCorp/DecentraCorpPoA

Once your Idea is approved by the DecentraCorp community you can add the EPMS.py script into your project and import the mineUseBlock function. This function should be put in a place in your code where it will be activated after your Idea meets its use-case criteria. For more information on the EPMS feel free to send an email to decentracorp@pm.me
